## About

Marketers use UTM parameters to track the effectiveness of online campaigns across traffic sources and publishing media.
The parameters identify the campaign that refers traffic to a specific website, and can be parsed by analytics tools and used to populate reports.

Copying these parameters and injecting them into your form submissions manually is tedious and error-prone, we built Formtrack to automate this integration.

## Installation & usage

Add the Formtrack script.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@formspark/formtrack"></script>
```

Add a `data-formtrack` attribute to your form element.

```html
<form action="https://submit-form.com" data-formtrack>
  <input type="text" name="message" />
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

Formtrack will now automatically inject the supported parameters into your HTML form submissions.
